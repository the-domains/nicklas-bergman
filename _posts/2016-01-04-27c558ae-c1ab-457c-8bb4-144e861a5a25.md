Nicklas Bergman has worked as a serial entrepreneur and technology investor for more
than 20 years. He has focused mostly on investments and business development in
emerging markets, web services, nanotechnology, computing, new materials, and new
media art, currently through close to 15 direct and indirect technology investments.

A couple of years ago he got tired of endless meetings with bankers, lawyers, and boards
of directors, cleared his schedule and embarked on a journey to understand where
technology is taking us and if we are ready for the upcoming techstorm. Today he is
dividing his time between existing and new technology investments, a couple of his own
projects and speaking and writing on the future of technology. Nicklas is also Scandinavian
representative of the TechCast Technology Think Tank in Washington DC.

Finally, Nicklas is working on a book project, "Surviving the Techstorm - Strategy in Times
of Technological Uncertainty", a handbook on how to deal with new technologies from a
business perspective. The book is being published by Lid Publishing in London, and will be
launched at Gary's Book Club at CES in Las Vegas in January 2016\.
