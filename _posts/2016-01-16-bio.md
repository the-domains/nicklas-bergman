Nicklas Bergman has worked as a serial entrepreneur and technology investor for more 
than 20 years. He has focused mostly on investments and business development in 
emerging markets, web services, nanotechnology, computing, new materials, and new 
media art, currently through close to 15 direct and indirect technology investments.

A couple of years ago he got tired of endless meetings with bankers, lawyers, and boards 
of directors, cleared his schedule and embarked on a journey to understand where 
technology is taking us and if we are ready for the upcoming techstorm. Today he is 
dividing his time between existing and new technology investments, a couple of his own startup projects and speaking and writing on the future of technology. Nicklas is also Scandinavian 
representative of the TechCast Technology Think Tank in Washington DC.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1409dc3c-6d0d-4b53-91f4-d3ec856d2bb5.jpg)
